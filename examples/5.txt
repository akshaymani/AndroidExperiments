-> Menus and Action Bar -> Text Views separate context menu [popup / action bar] but only a single options menu

-> Register for context menu - add items to context menu - onContextItemSelected - CountryFrag - delete a country on long click

-> Activities before HoneyComb used to get a title bar (title / embellishment) - no buttons etc - Now Action Bar is there [3 to 4 main options displayed - rest come in *** button, that is overflow menu and navigation control is there]

-> Navigation control is different from page swipe which is done using View Pager

-> TargetSDkVersion = 11 for Action Bar 

-> We can hide the action bar also

-> Action Items on our action bar vs the options menu

-> http://jgilfelt.github.io/android-actionbarstylegenerator/ - Android Action Bar Style Generator [Theme Value = Theme.MyCustomTheme - Android Manifest file]

-> Split Action Bar [Action Bar on top and bottom - android:uiOptions="splitActionBarWhenNarrow"]

-> FragmentStatePageAdaptor - If no of tabs is very high [destroys view + fragment] otherwise use FragmentPagerAdapter if no of tabs is like 5 to 6 [destroy view only]

-> Data Persistence [Internal / External Storage] - Even if external storage is not there in the device, some portion of internal storage is mounted as external storage

-> Android's file system is a Linux based system

-> [Important] In Linux we have a userID and we cannot write to other folders but in android the application gets a userID - Application Sandbox 

-> For every application - /databases - SQLiteDB , /lib - .so file is copied into the .apk file [not like linux machine], /shared_prefs [XML file is written - Key / Value pairs], 
	/cache - apps can use cache but if space is low, cache is cleared out and /files folder

-> Push and Pull files to emulator for testing purposes using DDMS or adb

-> Device is rooted or not - apps may not start depending on it :-o

-> MODE_WORLD_READABLE is not there jellybean onwards - File Output Stream [Internal Storage]

-> External Storage provides no security - path gets changed [getExternalSotrageState]

-> Shared Preferences UI Framework - Preference Activity [For example user tells upfront whether he wants to see Large Images or Small Images] - Root Node is the PreferenceScreen

-> SQLite Studio / Browser / Firefox Plugin / sqlite3 command line - For creating databases

-> MotionEvent Object -> Via the Activity, it is delivered to the child - Head Testing [Action - Down,Up,Move / Location / TimeStamp / Pressure / Size Of Touch (ellipse - finger) / etc.]

-> onTouchEvent - MotionEvent Object - Create a customized view - subclass of view

-> Content Provider allows sharing of data among applications - Pre-defined content providers in android in a particular package (android.provider) - MediaStore [to know all the media files on my system] / CallLog

-> Every data provider's provides a list of rows and columns - Every content provided has a content uri

-> For system apps we don't need the package name or authority name but for third party apps we need it

-> For querying content provider, we can't work with intents - we need content resolvers

-> Profiling our application - Make us of Trace View

-> For profiling memory - tool provided by eclipse - as android one is not there / not good :)

-> For memory profiling - DUMP HPROF File - But we can't load it as it is to Memory Analyzer - So need to convert it to format which analyzer can understand
	-> Inside platform-tools - hprof-conv sourcefilename destfilename [Full Path of the files is required] 
	-> Google I/O Talk for Memory Analying in Android

-> Enabling GPU Overdrar [Green takes 3 iterations - Red take 4 or more and so] - Developer Options in Android Phone

-> Monitoring Section - Profile GPU Rendering - Developer Options - Time taken to draw each frame

-> OpenGL Trace View in DDMS - To check for > 16 ms issues [Texture Calls]

-> To upload signed project - Android Tools Option on Right Click the Project and Export it to the Google Play Store

-> IOS apps have a manual review process - takes about week or so but Android some automated check is this

-> Proguard for securing our code in Android

-> 25 Dollars to become a member of Google Play Store - Ad Mob and not Ad Sense

-> NewsReader - Adding our custom permission
